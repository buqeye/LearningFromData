# Lecture 4: A couple of frequentist connections




## The near ubiquity of Gaussians

In the last lecture we considered a Gaussian distribution and
estimated its mean and variance. We are going to see a lot of Gaussian
distributions in this course. And indeed some people implicitly always
assume Gaussian distributions. So this seems like as good a place as
any to pause and consider why Gaussian distributions are a common
choice to describe noise, as well as thinking about the circumstances
in which that choice might be a poor one.

It turns out there are several reasons why one might choose a Gaussian
to describe a probability distribution. Here are two:

### The Gaussian is to statistics what the harmonic oscillator is to mechanics

Suppose we have a probability distribution $p(x | D,I)$ that is
unimodal (has only one hump), then one way to form a "best estimate''
for the variable $x$ is to compute the maximum of the
distribution. (To save writing we denote the pdf of interest as $p(x)$
for a while hereafter.)

We find this point, which we'll denote by $x_0$, using calculus:

$$
  \left.\frac{dp}{dx}\right|_{x_0} = 0
  \quad \mbox{with} \quad
    \left.\frac{d^2p}{dx^2}\right|_{x_0} < 0 \ \text{(maximum)}.
$$

To characterize the posterior $p(x)$, we look nearby. We want to know
how sharp this maximum is: is $p(x)$ sharply peaked around $x=x_0$ or
is the maximum kind-of shallow? To work this out we'll do a Taylor
expansion around $x=x_0$. 
$p(x)$ itself
varies too fast, but since $p(x)$ is positive definite we can
Taylor expand $\log p$ instead. (See the box below for a strict mathematical
reason why it's a bad idea to directly Taylor expand $p(x)$ around its
maximum.)


$$
 \Longrightarrow\ L(x) \equiv \log p(x|D,I) = 
   L(x_0) + \left.\frac{dL}{dx}\right|_{x_0 = 0}
   + \frac{1}{2} \left.\frac{d^2L}{dx^2}\right|_{x_0 = 0}(x-x_0)^2 + \cdots
$$

Note that $\left.\frac{d^2L}{dx^2}\right|_{x_0 = 0} < 0$.
If we can neglect higher-order terms, then

$$
  p(x| D,I) \approx A\, e^{\frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{d^2L}{dx^2}\right|_{x_0 = 0}(x-x_0)^2} ,
$$

with $A$ a normalization factor. So in this general circumstance we get a Gaussian. Comparing to

$$
  p(x|D,I) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-(x-\mu)^2/\sigma^2}
  \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  \mu = x_0, \ \sigma = \left(-\left.\frac{d^2L}{dx^2}\right|_{x_0}\right)^{-1/2}
$$

* We usually quote $x = x_0 \pm \sigma$, because *if* it is a Gaussian this is *sufficient* to tell us the entire distribution and $n$ standard deviations is $n\times \sigma$.

* But for a Bayesian, the full posterior $p(x|D,I)$ for all $x$ is
  the general result, and $x = x_0 \pm \sigma$ may be only an
  approximate characterization.

:::{admonition} $p$ or $\log p$?
* We motivated Gaussian approximations from a Taylor expansion to quadratic order of the *logarithm* of a pdf. 
What would go wrong if we directly expanded the pdf? Well, if we do
that we get:

$$
  p(x) \approx p(x_0) + \frac{1}{2}-\left.\frac{d^2p}{dx^2}\right|_{x_0}(x-x_0)^2
 \ \overset{x\pm\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} -\infty,
$$

i.e., we get something that diverges as $x$ tends to either plus or
minus infinity.

* A pdf must be normalizable and positive definite, so this approximation violates these conditions!

### The Central Limit Theorem

Another reason a Gaussian pdf emerges in many calculations is because
the Central Limit Theorem states that all (or almost all) probability
distributions will eventually produce Gaussians if you take enough
data (or, equivalently, draw enough samples) from them.

_Central Limit Theorem_: The sum of $n$ random values drawn from any
pdf of finite variance $\sigma^2$ tends as $n \rightarrow \infty$ to
be Gaussian distributed about the expectation value of the sum, with
variance $n \sigma^2$.

#### Consequences:

* The mean of a large number of values becomes normally distributed
  _regardless_ of the probability distiburtion the values are drawn
  from.

* The binomial, Poisson, Student's t-, and ... distributions all kind
  of look like Gaussian distributions in the limit of a large number
  of degrees of freedom.

#### Proof in a special case:

Start with *independent* random variables $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ drawn from a distribution with mean $\langle x \rangle = 0$ and variance $\langle x^2\rangle = \sigma^2$, where

$$
  \langle x^n \rangle \equiv \int x^n p(x)\, dx 
$$

(generalize later to nonzero mean). Now let 

$$
  X = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n)
   = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{x_j}{\sqrt{n}} ,   
$$

(we scale by $1/\sqrt{n}$ so that $X$ is finite in the $n\rightarrow\infty$ limit).

What is the distribution of $X$?
$\Longrightarrow$ call it $p(X|I)$, where $I$ is the information about the probability distribution for $x_j$. 

**Plan:** Use the sum and product rules and their consequences to relate $p(X)$ to what we know of $p(x_j)$. (Note: we'll suppress $I$ to keep the formulas from getting too cluttered.)

$$\begin{align}
  p(X) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx_1 \cdots dx_n\,
            p(X,x_1,\cdots,x_n) \\
       &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx_1 \cdots dx_n\,
            p(X|x_1,\cdots,x_n)\,p(x_1,\cdots,x_n) \\
       &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx_1 \cdots dx_n\,
            p(X|x_1,\cdots,x_n)\,p(x_1)\cdots p(x_n) .     
\end{align}$$

We might proceed by using a direct, normalized expression for $p(X|x_1,\cdots,x_n)$:
::::{admonition} Question
What is $p(X|x_1,\cdots,x_n)$?
:::{admonition} Answer
:class: dropdown 
$p(X|x_1,\cdots,x_n) = \delta\Bigl(X - \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(x_1 + \cdots + x_n)\Bigr)$
:::
::::

Instead we will use a Fourier representation:

$$
p(X|x_1,\cdots,x_n) = \delta\Bigl(X - \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}(x_1 + \cdots + x_n)\Bigr)
  = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega
    \, e^{i\omega\Bigl(X - \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\Bigr)} .
$$  

Substituting into $p(X)$ and gathering together all pieces with $x_j$ dependence while exchanging the order of integrations:

$$ 
 p(X) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} d\omega
    \, e^{i\omega X} \prod_{j=1}^n \left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx_j\, e^{i\omega x_j / \sqrt{n}} p(x_j) \right] 
$$ 

* Observe that the terms in []s have factorized into a product of independent integrals and they are all the same (just different labels for the integration variables).
* Now we Taylor expand $e^{i\omega x_j/\sqrt{n}}$, arguing that the Fourier integral is dominated by small $x$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. (*When does this fail?*)

$$
  e^{i\omega x/\sqrt{n}} = 1 + \frac{i\omega x}{\sqrt{n}}
    + \frac{(i\omega)^2 x^2}{2 n} + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\omega^3 x^3}{n^{3/2}}\right)
$$

Then, using that $p(x)$ is normalized (i.e., $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx\, p(x) = 1$), 


$$
\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx\, e^{i\omega x / \sqrt{n}}
p(x)&=
\int_{-\infty}^\infty dx p(x)
\left[1 +\frac{ i \omega x}{\sqrt{n}} + \frac{(i \omega)^2 x^2}{2 n} + \ldots\right]\\
&=1  + \frac{i \omega}{\sqrt{n}} \langle x \rangle  - \frac{\omega^2}{2
n^2} \langle x^2 \rangle + \langle x^3 \rangle
\frac{\omega^3}{n^{3/2}}\\
&=1 - \frac{\omega^2 \sigma^2}{2 n^2} +
\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\omega^3}{n^{3/2}}\right)
\end{align}
$$

Now we can substitute into the posterior for $X$ and take the large
$n$ limit:

$$
\begin{align}
p(X)&=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^\infty d \omega e^{i \omega X}
\left[1 - \frac{\omega^2 \sigma^2}{2 n^2} + \mathcal{O} \left(\frac{\omega^3}{n^{3/2}}\right)\right]^n\\
&\stackrel{n\rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow} \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int
d\omega e^{i \omega X} e^{- \omega^2 \sigma^2/2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2
\pi}} e^{-X^2/(2 \sigma^2)}.
\end{align}
$$



#### Notebook:

Look at [](/notebooks/Basics/visualization_of_CLT.ipynb).

Things to think about:

* What does ``large'' number of degrees of freedom acutally mean? Does
it matter where we look?

* Can you identify a case where the CLT will fail?



## p-values: when all you can do is falsify

* A common way for a frequentist to discuss a theory/model, or put a
bound on a parameter value, is to quote a p-value.

* This is set up using something called the null hypothesis. Somewhat
  perversely you should pick the null hypothesis to be the opposite of
  what you want to prove. So if you want to discover the Higgs boson,
  the null hypothesis is that the Higgs boson does not exist.

* Then you pick a level of proof you are comfortable with. For the
  Higgs boson (and for many other particle physics experiments) it is
  "5 sigma''. How do you think we convert this statement to a
  probability?

* One minus the resulting probability is called the $p$-value. We will
  denote it $p_{\rm crit}$. There is nothing
  God-given about it. It is a standard (like "beyond a resaonable
  doubt") that has been established in a research community for
  determining that something is (likely) going on. 

* You then take data and compute $p(D|{\rm null~hypothesis})$. If
  $p(D|{\rm null~ hypothesis}) < p_{\rm crit}$ then you conclude that the "the null
  hypothesis is rejected at the $p_{\rm crit}$ significance level''.

* Note that if $p(D|{null~hypothesis}) > p_{\rm crit}$ you cannot
  conculde that the null hypothesis is true. It just means "no effect
  was observeed".

* Look at
  [](/notebooks/Basics/Bayesian_updating_coinflip_interactive.ipynb). Pick
  a $p$-value. If  $H=0.4$ work out how many coin tosses it would take
  to reject the null hypothesis that it's a fair coin ($H=0.5$) at
  that $p$-value.


## Bayesian degree of belief intervals and frequentist confidence intervals

In class on Wednesday we also talked about the difference between the
68% degree of belief interval for the most likely value (in that case
the bias weighting of the coin) and a frequentist $1 \sigma$ confidence
interval.

* First point is that $1 \sigma=68$% assumes a Gaussian distribution
  around the maximum of the posterior (cf. above). While this will
  often work out okay, it may not. And, as we seek to translate, 
  $n \sigma$ intervals into DoB statements, assuming a Gaussian
  becomes more and more questionable the higher $n$ is. (Why?)

* But the second point is more philosophical (meta-statistical?). One
  interval is a statement about $p(x|D,I)$, while the other is a
  statement about $p(D|x,I)$.

* (Note that because the conversion between the two pdfs requires the
 use of Bayes' theorem the Bayesian interval may be affected by the
 choice of the prior.)

* Bayesian version is easy; a 68% credible interval or Bayesian
  confidence interval or degree-of-belief (DoB) interval is: given
  some data and some information $I$, there is a 68% chance (probability) that the interval contains the true parameter. 

* Frequentist 68% confidence interval
    * Assuming the model (contained in $I$) and the value of the
      parameter $x$ then if we do the experiment a large number of
      times then 68% of them will produce data in that interval.
   * So the *parameter* is fixed (no pdf) and the confidence
     interval is a statement about data
   * Frequentists will try to make statements about parameters, but
     they end up a bit tangled, e.g., "There is a 68% probability
     that when I compute a confidence interval from data of this sort
     that the true value of $\theta$ will fall within the
     (hypothetical) space of observations."


* For a one-dimensional posterior that is symmetric, it is clear how to define the $d\%$ confidence interval. 
    * Algorithm: start from the center, step outward on both sides, stop when $d\%$ is enclosed.
    * For a two-dimensional posterior, need a way to integrate from the top. (Could lower a plane, as desribed below for HPD.)

* What if asymmetic or multimodal? Two of the possible choices:
    * Equal-tailed interval (central interval): the area above and below the interval are equal.
    * Highest posterior density (HPD) region: posterior density for
      every point is higher than the posterior density for any point
      outside the
      interval. [E.g., lower a horizontal line over the distribution until the desired interval percentage is covered by regions above the line.]
