MLE can lead to severe overfitting though.\n",

Maximizing $p(\\mathcal{D} \\lvert \\boldsymbol{w}) p(\\boldsymbol{w})$ gives the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of $\\boldsymbol{w}$.

These probability distributions describe the uncertainty in weights and can be used to estimate uncertainty in predictions. Training a Bayesian neural network via variational inference learns the parameters of these distributions instead of the weights directly.\n",

    "In the example used in the blog post, they use a Gaussian distribution for the variational posterior, parameterized by $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma})$ where $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ is the mean vector of the distribution and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ the standard deviation vector. The elements of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ are the elements of a diagonal covariance matrix which means that weights are assumed to be uncorrelated. Instead of parameterizing the neural network with weights $\\boldsymbol{w}$ directly, it is parameterized with $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and therefore the number of parameters are doubled compared to a plain neural network.\n",

    "### Network training\n",
    "\n",
    "A training iteration consists of a forward-pass and and backward-pass. During a forward pass a single sample is drawn from the variational posterior distribution. It is used to evaluate the approximate cost function defined by equation ([4](#eq:VariationalFreeEnergy)). The first two terms of the cost function are data-independent and can be evaluated layer-wise, the last term is data-dependent and is evaluated at the end of the forward-pass. During a backward-pass, gradients of $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ are calculated via backpropagation so that their values can be updated by an optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a forward pass involves a stochastic sampling step we have to apply the so-called *re-parameterization trick* for backpropagation to work. The trick is to sample from a parameter-free distribution and then transform the sampled $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ with a deterministic function $t(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon})$ for which a gradient can be defined. In the blog post they choose $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ to be drawn from a standard normal distribution i.e. $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{0}, \\boldsymbol{I})$ and the function $t$ is taken to be $t(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}, \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}) = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\odot \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, i.e., it shifts the sample by mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and scales it with $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ where $\\odot$ is element-wise multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "For numerical stability the network is parametrized with $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ instead of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ is transformed with the softplus function to obtain $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\log(1 + \\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}))$. This ensures that $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is always positive. As prior, a scale mixture of two Gaussians is used $p(\\boldsymbol{w}) = \\pi \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{w} \\lvert 0,\\sigma_1^2) + (1 - \\pi) \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{w} \\lvert 0,\\sigma_2^2)$ where $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$ and $\\pi$ are shared parameters. Their values are learned during training (which is in contrast to the paper where a fixed prior is used).\n",
