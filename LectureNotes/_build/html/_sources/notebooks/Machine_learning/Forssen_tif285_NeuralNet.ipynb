    "Artificial neural networks are computational systems that can learn to\n",
    "perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being\n",
    "programmed with any task-specific rules. It is supposed to mimic a\n",
    "biological system, wherein neurons interact by sending signals in the\n",
    "form of mathematical functions between layers. All layers can contain\n",
    "an arbitrary number of neurons, and each connection is represented by\n",

    "\n",
    "Each time we describe a neural network algorithm we will typically specify three things. \n",
    "\n",
    "Architecture:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  The architecture specifies what variables are involved in the network and their topological relationships – for example, the variables involved in a neural net might be the weights of the connections between the neurons, along with the activities of the neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activity rule:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  Most neural network models have short time-scale dynamics: local rules define how the activities of the neurons change in response to each other. Typically the activity rule depends on the weights (the parameters) in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rule:\n",
    "  :    \n",
    "  The learning rule specifies the way in which the neural network’s weights change with time. This learning is usually viewed as taking place on a longer time scale than the time scale of the dynamics under the activity rule. Usually the learning rule will depend on the activities of the neurons. It may also depend on the values of target values supplied by a teacher and on the current value of the weights.\n",

    "general idea is to mimic neural networks in the human brain, which is\n",
    "composed of billions of neurons that communicate with each other by\n",
    "sending electrical signals.  Each neuron accumulates its incoming\n",
    "signals, which must exceed an activation threshold to yield an\n",
    "output. If the threshold is not overcome, the neuron remains inactive,\n",

    "Conceptually, it is helpful to divide neural networks into four\n",
    "categories:\n",
    "1. general purpose neural networks, including deep neural networks (DNN) with several hidden layers, for supervised learning,\n",

    "plethora of applications in essentially all disciplines, from the\n",
    "humanities to life science and medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural network types\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network (ANN), is a computational model that\n",
    "consists of layers of connected neurons, or nodes or units.  We will\n",
    "refer to these interchangeably as units or nodes, and sometimes as\n",
    "neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is supposed to mimic a biological nervous system by letting each\n",
    "neuron interact with other neurons by sending signals in the form of\n",
    "mathematical functions between layers.  A wide variety of different\n",
    "ANNs have been developed, but most of them consist of an input layer,\n",
    "an output layer and eventual layers in-between, called *hidden\n",
    "layers*. All layers can contain an arbitrary number of nodes, and each\n",
    "connection between two nodes is associated with a weight variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks (also called neural nets) are neural-inspired\n",
    "nonlinear models for supervised learning.  As we will see, neural nets\n",
    "can be viewed as natural, more powerful extensions of supervised\n",
    "learning methods such as linear and logistic regression and soft-max\n",
    "methods we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feed-forward neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was the first and simplest type\n",
    "of ANNs that were devised. In this network, the information moves in\n",
    "only one direction: forward through the layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes are represented by circles, while the arrows display the\n",
    "connections between the nodes, including the direction of information\n",
    "flow. Additionally, each arrow corresponds to a weight variable\n",
    "(figure to come).  We observe that each node in a layer is connected\n",
    "to *all* nodes in the subsequent layer, making this a so-called\n",
    "*fully-connected* FFNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "A different variant of FFNNs are *convolutional neural networks*\n",
    "(CNNs), which have a connectivity pattern inspired by the animal\n",
    "visual cortex. Individual neurons in the visual cortex only respond to\n",
    "stimuli from small sub-regions of the visual field, called a receptive\n",
    "field. This makes the neurons well-suited to exploit the strong\n",
    "spatially local correlation present in natural images. The response of\n",
    "each neuron can be approximated mathematically as a convolution\n",
    "operation.  (figure to come)\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks emulate the behaviour of neurons in the\n",
    "visual cortex by enforcing a *local* connectivity pattern between\n",
    "nodes of adjacent layers: Each node in a convolutional layer is\n",
    "connected only to a subset of the nodes in the previous layer, in\n",
    "contrast to the fully-connected FFNN.  Often, CNNs consist of several\n",
    "convolutional layers that learn local features of the input, with a\n",
    "fully-connected layer at the end, which gathers all the local data and\n",
    "produces the outputs. They have wide applications in image and video\n",
    "recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrent neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only mentioned ANNs where information flows in one\n",
    "direction: forward. *Recurrent neural networks* on the other hand,\n",
    "have connections between nodes that form directed *cycles*. This\n",
    "creates a form of internal memory which are able to capture\n",
    "information on what has been calculated before; the output is\n",
    "dependent on the previous computations. Recurrent NNs make use of\n",
    "sequential information by performing the same task for every element\n",
    "in a sequence, where each element depends on previous elements. An\n",
    "example of such information is sentences, making recurrent NNs\n",
    "especially well-suited for handwriting and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other kinds of ANNs that have been developed. One type\n",
    "that is specifically designed for interpolation in multidimensional\n",
    "space is the radial basis function (RBF) network. RBFs are typically\n",
    "made up of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with\n",
    "non-linear radial symmetric activation functions and a linear output\n",
    "layer (''linear'' here means that each node in the output layer has a\n",
    "linear activation function). The layers are normally fully-connected\n",
    "and there are no cycles, thus RBFs can be viewed as a type of\n",
    "fully-connected FFNN. They are however usually treated as a separate\n",
    "type of NN due the unusual activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multilayer perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "The *multilayer perceptron* (MLP) is a very popular, and easy to implement approach, to deep learning. It consists of\n",
    "1. a neural network with one or more layers of nodes between the input and the output nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. the multilayer network structure, or architecture, or topology, consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and one output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. the input nodes pass values to the first hidden layer, its nodes pass the information on to the second and so on till we reach the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a convention it is normal to call a network with one layer of input units, one layer of hidden units and one layer of output units as  a two-layer network. A network with two layers of hidden units is called a three-layer network etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of input nodes does not need to equal the number of output\n",
    "nodes. This applies also to the hidden layers. Each layer may have its\n",
    "own number of nodes and activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layers have their name from the fact that they are not\n",
    "linked to observables and as we will see below when we define the\n",
    "so-called activation $\\boldsymbol{z}$, we can think of this as a basis\n",
    "expansion of the original inputs $\\boldsymbol{x}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why multilayer perceptrons?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [universal approximation\n",
    "theorem](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.441.7873&rep=rep1&type=pdf), a feed-forward\n",
    "neural network with just a single hidden layer containing a finite\n",
    "number of neurons can approximate a continuous multidimensional\n",
    "function to arbitrary accuracy, assuming the activation function for\n",
    "the hidden layer is a **non-constant, bounded and\n",
    "monotonically-increasing continuous function**. The theorem thus\n",
    "states that simple neural networks can represent a wide variety of\n",
    "interesting functions when given appropriate parameters. It is the\n",
    "multilayer feedforward architecture itself which gives neural networks\n",
    "the potential of being universal approximators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the requirements on the activation function only applies to\n",

    "It is crucial that we do not use any of the test data to train the algorithm. This is a cardinal sin in ML. T If the validation and test sets are drawn from the same distributions, then a good performance on the validation set should lead to similarly good performance on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes\n",
    "the training data and test data differ in subtle ways because, for\n",

    "\n",
    "Like all statistical methods, supervised learning using neural\n",

    "one seeks to apply these methods, especially to physics problems. Like\n",
    "all tools, DNNs are not a universal solution. Often, the same or\n",
    "better performance on a task can be achieved by using a few\n",
    "hand-engineered features (or even a collection of random\n",
    "features). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we list some of the important limitations of supervised neural network based models. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Need labeled data**. All supervised learning methods, DNNs for supervised learning require labeled data. Often, labeled data is harder to acquire than unlabeled data (e.g. one must pay for human experts to label images).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Supervised neural networks are extremely data intensive.** DNNs are data hungry. They perform best when data is plentiful. This is doubly so for supervised methods where the data must also be labeled. The utility of DNNs is extremely limited if data is hard to acquire or the datasets are small (hundreds to a few thousand samples). In this case, the performance of other methods that utilize hand-engineered features can exceed that of DNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneous data.** Almost all DNNs deal with homogeneous data of one type. It is very hard to design architectures that mix and match data types (i.e. some continuous variables, some discrete variables, some time series). In applications beyond images, video, and language, this is often what is required. In contrast, ensemble models like random forests or gradient-boosted trees have no difficulty handling mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Many problems are not about prediction.** In natural science we are often interested in learning something about the underlying distribution that generates the data. In this case, it is often difficult to cast these ideas in a supervised learning setting. While the problems are related, it is possible to make good predictions with a *wrong* model. The model might or might not be useful for understanding the underlying science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these remarks are particular to DNNs, others are shared by all supervised learning methods. This motivates the use of unsupervised methods which in part circumvent these problems."
