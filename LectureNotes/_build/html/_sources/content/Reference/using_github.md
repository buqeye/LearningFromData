# Using GitHub

## Installation of LearningFromData Jupyter notebooks from GitHub by command line

Go to the location where you want the notebook files. 

Download the Jupyter Book repository from GitHub and then enter the directory `LearningFromData` which will be created on your computer by entering these two statements:

    git clone https://github.com/buqeye/LearningFromData.git
    cd LearningFromData

The notebooks that we will be using depend on several scientific python modules (see the list in environment.yml) and require a python3.x installation based on Anaconda.
