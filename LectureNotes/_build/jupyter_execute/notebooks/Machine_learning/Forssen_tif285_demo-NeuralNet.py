# ## Developing a code for doing neural networks with back propagation
# 
# One can identify a set of key steps when using neural networks to solve supervised learning problems:  
#   
# 1. Collect and pre-process data  
# 1. Define model and architecture  
# 1. Choose cost function and optimizer  
# 1. Train the model  
# 1. Evaluate model performance on test data  
# 1. Adjust hyperparameters (if necessary, network architecture)

# ### Introduction to tensorflow
# This short introduction uses Keras to:
# * Build a neural network that classifies images.
# * Train this neural network.
# * And, finally, evaluate the accuracy of the model.
# 
# See [https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) for more details

# See also the [Tensorflow classification tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)

# In[2]:


# Install TensorFlow by updating the conda environment

import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)


# Load and prepare the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Convert the samples from integers to floating-point numbers:

# In[3]:


mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist

(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()


# The images are 28x28 NumPy arrays, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. The labels are an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9. 

# ### Explore the data

# In[4]:


# The shape of the training data
x_train.shape


# In[5]:


# Each training label is an integer
y_train


# In[6]:


plt.figure()
plt.imshow(x_train[0])
plt.colorbar()
plt.grid(False)


# Scale these values to a range of 0 to 1 before feeding them to the neural network model. To do so, divide the values by 255. It's important that the training set and the testing set be preprocessed in the same way:

# In[7]:


x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0


# To verify that the data is in the correct format and that you're ready to build and train the network, let's display the first 25 images from the training set and display the class name below each image.

# In[8]:


plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5,5,i+1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(x_train[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    plt.xlabel(str(y_train[i]))


# ### Build the network

# The basic building block of a neural network is the layer. Layers extract representations from the data fed into them. Hopefully, these representations are meaningful for the problem at hand.
# 
# Most of deep learning consists of chaining together simple layers. Most layers, such as [`tf.keras.layers.Dense`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense), have parameters that are learned during training.

# Build the [tf.keras.Sequential](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Sequential) model by stacking layers. Choose an optimizer and loss function for training:

# In[9]:


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])


# The first layer in this network, [`tf.keras.layers.Flatten`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Flatten), transforms the format of the images from a two-dimensional array (of 28 by 28 pixels) to a one-dimensional array (of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels). Think of this layer as unstacking rows of pixels in the image and lining them up. This layer has no parameters to learn; it only reformats the data.
# 
# After the pixels are flattened, the network consists two [`tf.keras.layers.Dense`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense) layers. These are densely connected, or fully connected, neural layers. The first Dense layer has 128 nodes (or neurons). The second (and last) layer is a 10-node softmax layer that returns an array of 10 probability scores that sum to 1. Each node contains a score that indicates the probability that the current image belongs to one of the 10 classes.
# 
# In between the Dense layers is a [`tf.keras.layers.Dropout`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dropout) layer. Dropout consists in randomly setting a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.

# Before the model is ready for training, it needs a few more settings. These are added during the model's compile step:
# 
# * *Loss function* — This measures how accurate the model is during training. You want to minimize this function to "steer" the model in the right direction.
# * *Optimizer* — This is how the model is updated based on the data it sees and its loss function.
# * *Metrics* — Used to monitor the training and testing steps. The following example uses accuracy, the fraction of the images that are correctly classified.

# In[10]:


model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])


# ### Train and evaluate the model:

# In[11]:


model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)


# ### Evaluate accuracy
# Next, compare how the model performs on the test dataset:

# In[13]:


test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test,  y_test, verbose=2)

print('\nTest accuracy:', test_acc)


# ### Make predictions
# With the model trained, you can use it to make predictions about some images.

# In[14]:


predictions = model.predict(x_test)

# Let's look at the prediction for the first test image
predictions[0]


# In[16]:


# Check the normalization of the output probabilities
np.sum(predictions[0])


# In[17]:


# Which prob is largest?
np.argmax(predictions[0])


# In[18]:


# Examining the test label shows that this classification is correct:
y_test[0]


# In[23]:


# Some helper functions for nice plotting
