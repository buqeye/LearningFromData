# # Checking the sum and product rules, and their consequences

# Goal: Check using a very simple example that the Bayesian rules are consistent with standard probabilities based on frequencies.  Also check notation and vocabulary.

# ## Bayesian rules of probability as principles of logic 
# 
# Notation: $p(x \mid I)$ is the probability (or pdf) of $x$ being true
# given information $I$
# 
# 1. **Sum rule:** If set $\{x_i\}$ is exhaustive and exclusive, 
# 
#     $$ \sum_i p(x_i  \mid  I) = 1   \quad \longrightarrow \quad       \color{red}{\int\!dx\, p(x \mid I) = 1} 
#     $$ 
#     
#     * cf. complete and orthonormal 
#     * implies *marginalization* (cf. inserting complete set of states or integrating out variables - but be careful!)
#     
#     $$
#        p(x \mid  I) = \sum_j p(x,y_j \mid I) 
#         \quad \longrightarrow \quad
#        \color{red}{p(x \mid I) = \int\!dy\, p(x,y \mid I)} 
#     $$
#    
#   
# 2. **Product rule:** expanding a joint probability of $x$ and $y$         
# 
#     $$
#          \color{red}{ p(x,y \mid I) = p(x \mid y,I)\,p(y \mid I)
#               = p(y \mid x,I)\,p(x \mid I)}
#     $$
# 
#     * If $x$ and $y$ are <em>mutually independent</em>:  $p(x \mid y,I)
#       = p(x \mid I)$, then        
#     
#     $$
#        p(x,y \mid I) \longrightarrow p(x \mid I)\,p(y \mid I)
#     $$
#     
#     * Rearranging the second equality yields <em> Bayes' Rule (or Theorem)</em>
#     
#     $$
#       \color{blue}{p(x  \mid y,I) = \frac{p(y \mid x,I)\, 
#        p(x \mid I)}{p(y \mid I)}}
#     $$
# 
# See Cox for the proof.

# 1. Table 1 shows the number of blue- or brown-eyed and tall or short individuals in a population of 75.
# 
#     *Fill in the blanks in Table 2 with probabilities (in decimals with three places, not fractions) based on the usual "frequentist" interpretations of probability* (which would say that the probability of randomly drawing an ace from a deck of cards is 4/52 = 1/13). *Add x's in the row and/or column that illustrates the sum rule.*
#  <br>
#  <br>
# 2. *What is $p(short, blue)$? Is this a joint or conditional probability?  What is $p(blue)$? 
#  <br>From the product rule, what is $p(short | blue)$?  Can you read this result directly from the table?*
#  <br>
#  <br>
#  <br>
#  <br>
# 3. *Apply Bayes' theorem to find $p(blue | short)$ from your answers to the last part.*
#  <br>
#  <br>
#  <br>
#  <br>
# 4. *What rule does the second row (the one starting with "Short") illustrate?  Write it out in $p(\cdot)$ notation.* 
# <br>
# <br>
# <br>
# 5. *Are the probabilities of being tall and having brown eyes mutually independent?  Why or why not?*
