# ### Determining the bias of a coin

# The idea here is that we are observing successive flips of a coin, which is a proxy for any process that has a binary outcome.  There is a definite true probability for getting heads, which we'll label $p_h$, but we don't know what it is.  We start with a preconceived notion of the probability expressed in terms of a prior pdf for $p_h$, i.e., $\pr(p_h)$.  With each flip of the coin, we have more information, so our goal is to <em>update</em> our expectation of $p_h$, meaning we want the posterior $\pr(p_h \mid \mbox{# tosses, # heads})$.

# Questions and tasks relating to priors and dealing with uncertainty: 
# * *What prior would you choose? How does this affect how long it takes you to arrive at the correct conclusion?* Note that the answer to this question may be $p_H$ dependent.
# * *What would your standard be for deciding the coin was so unfair that you would walk away? That you'd call the police? That you'd try and publish the fact that you found an unfair coin in a scientific journal?* Hint: for the last one try thinking in terms of a "p value". If you don't know what that mean google "hypothesis testing".
# * *What if you were **sure** the coin was unfair before you started? (E.g. you saw the person doctoring it.) What prior would you choose then? What happens to the posterior in this case?*  This one may be best answered without any hitting of shift-return.....
