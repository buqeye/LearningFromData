# # Exploring PDFs
# 
# Goals: To play with plots of probability density functions (pdfs) using the `scipy.stats` and `numpy` libraries. 
# Work through the notebook but don't just follow the instructions.  Explore!
# 
# **Answer the questions in** *italics*. **Check with your neighbors and ask for help if you get stuck or are unsure.**

# ## Quick overview: To a Bayesian, everything is a pdf (probability density function)
# 
# Physicists are used to dealing with pdfs as normalized wave functions squared.  For a one-dimensional particle, the probability density at $x$ is
# 
# <span style="color: red">
#  $$
#  |\Psi(x)|^2 \Longrightarrow p(x) 
#  $$
# </span> 
# 
# The *probability* of finding $x$ in some interval $a \leq x \leq b$ is found by integration:
# 
# <span style="color: red">
#  $$
#  p(a \leq x \leq b) = \int_a^b |\Psi(x)|^2 \; dx 
#  $$
# </span> 
# 
# 
# Just as with "Lagrangian" vs. "Lagrangian density", physicists are not always careful when saying probability vs. probability density.
# 
# Physicists are also used to multidimensional normalized pdfs as wave functions squared, e.g. probability density for particle 1 at $x_1$ and particle 2 at $x_2$:
# 
# <span style="color: red">
#  $$
#  |\Psi(x_1, x_2)|^2 \Longrightarrow p(x_1,x_2) \equiv p(\textbf{x})  
#    \quad \mbox{with}\quad \textbf{x} 
#  \equiv \{x_1,x_2\}
#  $$
# </span> 
# 
# (Note that you will find alternative notation in the physics and statistics literature for generic pdfs: $p(\textbf{x}) = P(\textbf{x}) = \textrm{pr}(\textbf{x}) = \textrm{prob}(\textbf{x}) = \ldots$ )
# 
# Some other vocabulary and definitions:
# * $p(x_1,x_2)$ is the <em>joint probability density</em> of $x_1$ and $x_2$. <br>
# * What is the probability to find particle 1 at $x_1$ and particle 2 anywhere?  $\color{blue}{\int\! |\Psi(x_1,x_2)|^2 dx_2}$ (integrated over the full domain of $x_2$, e.g., 0 to $\infty$).<br>
# * The <em>marginal probability density</em> of $x_1$ is: 
# $\color{blue}{p(x_1) = \int\! p(x_1,x_2)\,dx_2}$. <br>
# * "Marginalizing" = "integrating out" (eliminates from the posterior the "nuisance parameters" whose value you don't care about).  
# 
# In Bayesian statistics there are pdfs (or pmfs if discrete) for experimental <i>and</i> theoretical uncertainties, fit parameters, hyperparameters (what are those?), events ("Will it rain tomorrow?"), etc.  Even if $x$ has the definite value $x_0$, we can use the pdf $p(x) = \delta(x-x_0)$.

# ### Quick introduction to  `scipy.stats`
# 
# If you google "scipy.stats", you'll likely get the manual page as the first hit: [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html ].  Here you'll find a long list of the continuous and discrete distributions that are available, followed (scroll way down) by many different methods (functions) to extract properties of a distribution (called "Summary Statistics") and do many other statistical tasks.
# 
# Follow the link for any of the distributions (your choice!) to find its mathematical definition, some examples of how to use it, and a list of methods. Some methods of interest to us here:
# * mean() - Mean of the distribution.
# * median() - Median of the distribution.
# * pdf(x) - Value of the probability density function at x.
# * rvs(size=num_pts) - generate num_pts random values of the pdf.
# * interval(alpha) - Endpoints of the range that contains alpha percent of the distribution.
# 
# *Try out some of the examples* (cut-and-paste from the manual page after turning off the >>>s by clicking in the upper right of a box).  We'll use all of these methods in explicit examples below.

# ### Matplotlib plotting definitions
# 
# We first define a few functions that we'll use to extract and plot quantities of interest. 
# 
# *After you've looked at the examples that follow, come back and make sure you know what the functions are doing.*

mu2 = beta2_dist.mean()

ax3.plot(x_beta, norm2_dist.pdf(x_beta), color='red')

fig.tight_layout()


# The 68%/95% probability regions are shown in dark/light shading.  When applied to Bayesian posteriors, these are known as <em>credible intervals</em> or DoBs (degree of belief intervals) or Bayesian confidence intervals. The horizontal extent on the $x$-axis translates into the vertical extent of the error bar or error band for $x$.
# 

# The values of the mode, mean, median can be used as *point estimates* for the "probable" value of $x$.  
# *If you had a symmetric bimodal distribution, what point estimate would be best?  Or are they all poor?* 

# Things to try:
# * Change the normal (Gaussian) distribution so that it has a different mean and standard deviation.
# * Add another plot to one of the graphs. E.g., generate a normal distribution with the same mean and about the same width as the beta distribution with $a=10$, $b=10$ and add it to that plot.  You don't need to call a special function, just use `norm2_dist = stats.norm(mu2, sigma2)` with your guesses for the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ values and then `ax3.plot(x_beta, norm2_dist.pdf(x_beta), color='red')` to overlay the curve on `ax3`.  
# * Try some other distributions.

# ### Another standard class of pdf:  Student t

# *Find the functional definition on the web page.  Is it consistent with the plots?*
# 
# *What are the `loc` and `scale` parameters?*

# In[5]:



# Make some plots of the Student t distribution
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15,5))

x_t = np.linspace(-5, 5, 500)

norm1_dist = stats.norm(0.,1.)  # a normal distribution for comparison

ax1 = fig.add_subplot(1,3,1)
dist_plot(ax1, t1_label, x_t, t1_dist)
ax1.plot(x_t, norm1_dist.pdf(x_t), color='red')

nu2 = 3
t2_dist = stats.t(nu2) # the Student t distribution
t2_label = 't pdf' + '\n' + rf'$\nu=${nu2:1.1f}'
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(1,3,2)
dist_plot(ax2, t2_label, x_t, t2_dist)
#ax2.plot(x_t, norm1_dist.pdf(x_t), color='red')

nu3 = 100
t3_dist = stats.t(nu3) # the Student t distribution
t3_label = 't pdf' + '\n' + rf'$\nu=${nu3:1.1f}'
ax3 = fig.add_subplot(1,3,3)
dist_plot(ax3, t3_label, x_t, t3_dist)
#ax3.plot(x_t, norm1_dist.pdf(x_t), color='red')

var2 = t2_dist.var()

print(f'variance for nu2: {var2}')


# Note the "heavy tails" in the t distribution as $\nu$ gets small.  As $\nu$ gets large, the distribution approaches a standard normal (Gaussian) distribution.
# 
# *Try superposing a normal pdf on each.*  (The code is already there, just commented out, but make sure you understand what the statements are doing.)
# 
# *What is the variance of each of the t distributions (use the `var` method)?  Any surprises?* 

# ### Projected posterior plots

# Here we use the [corner package](https://corner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) to make some projected posterior plots. (Note: there are other choices to make these plots but corner is really fast.)

# To do:
# *Find the mean of the random samples and compare to $\mu=0$ for each sample size.* (You might add a statement to the `plot_hist` function to print the mean, using that `samples.mean()` (don't forget the ()'s) gives the mean of the distribution `samples`.)  *Conclusion?*
