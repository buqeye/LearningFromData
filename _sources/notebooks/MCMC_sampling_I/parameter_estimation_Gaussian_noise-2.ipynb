    "## Applying the Bayesian approach\n",
    "Leaving these philosophical debates aside for the time being, let's address how Bayesian results are generally computed in practice. For a one parameter problem like the one considered here, it's as simple as computing the posterior probability $p(\\mu,\\sigma~|~D,I)$ as a function of $\\mu,\\sigma$: this is the distribution reflecting our knowledge of the parameter $\\mu,\\sigma$. But as the dimension of the model grows, this direct approach becomes increasingly intractable. For this reason, Bayesian calculations often depend on sampling methods such as [Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo). \n",

    "We won't go into the details of the theory of MCMC here (again, we will be discussing this topic during the course). Instead we will show a practical example of applying an MCMC approach using Dan Foreman-Mackey's excellent [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/current/)  package.  Keep in mind here that the goal is to *generate a set of points drawn from the posterior probability distribution*, and to use those points to determine the answer we seek.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this MCMC, we start by defining Python functions for the prior $p(\\mu,\\sigma~|~I)$, the likelihood $p(D~|~\\mu,\\sigma, I)$, and the posterior $p(\\mu,\\sigma~|~D,I)$, noting that none of these need be properly normalized. Our model here is two-dimensional so we'll define the model in terms of an array of parameters $\\theta$, which in this case is $\\theta = [\\mu,\\sigma]$:"
